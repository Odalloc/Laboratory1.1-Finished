	<p>Soul King" Brook is the musician of the Straw Hat Pirates. He is the ninth member of the crew and the eighth to join, doing so at the end of the Thriller Bark Arc.
	<br><br>
	Brook ate the Yomi Yomi no Mi, which allowed him to return to life after death once. Brook eventually learned to tap deeper into the powers of his Devil Fruit, giving him nominal control over his own soul and the souls of others. His dream is to reunite with his old friend, Laboon, at Reverse Mountain, where he resides with Crocus.
	<br><br>
	Originally a member of the Rumbar Pirates, he died and was resurrected through the power of the Yomi Yomi no Mi. However, due to the amount of time it took for his soul to find his body, it was reduced to a skeleton, keeping only his afro intact. Brook drifted alone in the Florian Triangle for 50 years, eventually meeting Luffy and serving as the Straw Hats' ally during the Thriller Bark Arc before officially joining the crew.
	<br><br>
	He currently has a bounty of 83,000,000 Beli.</p>
