	<p>Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw Hat", is the main protagonist of the manga and anime, One Piece. He is the founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as one of its top three fighters. His lifelong dream is to become the Pirate King by finding the legendary treasure left behind by the late Gol D. Roger. He believes that being Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.
	<br><br>
	Luffy is the son of the Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon, the grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp, the sworn brother of late "Fire Fist" Portgas D. Ace and Revolutionary Chief-of-Staff Sabo, and the foster son of Curly Dadan. He is one of the few people in the world that carry the Will of D.
	<br><br>
	Luffy has gone up against many of the global powers around him, starting with fighting the most powerful pirates in the East Blue and moving to clashes against the Marines, Seven Warlords of the Sea, World Nobles, and Four Emperors in the Grand Line; he has emerged victorious in the majority of these battles. Luffy's accomplishments and heritage have caused him to be labeled as a "Dangerous Future Element", earning the wrath of Fleet Admiral Sakazuki, the Marine Headquarters and even the World Government. Luffy also has a penchant for attracting followers and is currently the unofficial leader of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, consisting of seven pirate crews who will aid him whenever he wishes. After learning of this and his exploits against the Big Mom Pirates, the press has labeled him the "Fifth Emperor of the Sea", though many prominent figures consider this to be exaggerated.
	<br><br>
	These acts, among other things, have given him his current bounty of 1,500,000,000 Beli. Having had a bounty of 300,000,000 Beli prior to his arrival at the Sabaody Archipelago, Luffy is one of eleven rookie pirates who simultaneously reached the Red Line with bounties over 100,000,000 Beli, a group which would go on to be referred to as the "Worst Generation."</p>
