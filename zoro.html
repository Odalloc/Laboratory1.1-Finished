	<p>Roronoa Zoro, also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro, is a swordsman and combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates. Formerly a bounty hunter, he is the second member of the crew and the first to join, doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc.
	<br><br>
	A master of Santoryu, Zoro is among the four most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy, Sanji and Jinbe. His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world, in order to honor a promise he made to his deceased childhood friend Kuina.
	<br><br>
	In addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats, Zoro is also regarded as one of twelve pirates who are referred to as the "Worst Generation".
	<br><br>
	He currently has a bounty of 320,000,000 Beli.</p>
