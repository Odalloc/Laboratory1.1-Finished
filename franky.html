	<p>"Iron Man" Franky is the shipwright of the Straw Hat Pirates. He is the eighth member of the crew and the seventh to join, doing so at the end of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc.
	<br><br>
	Born "Cutty Flam", he chose to go by his nickname of "Franky" until eventually permanently discarding his true name per the request of Iceburg to hide his identity. He was originally from South Blue, but was abandoned by his family as a four-year-old child, eventually making his way to Water 7. There he became a member of Tom's Workers, until an incident resulted in his body being heavily damaged and requiring him to augment himself into a cyborg. Upon returning to Water 7, he became the leader of the Franky Family, a group of ship dismantlers.
	<br><br>
	Franky and his followers were originally enemies of the Straw Hats at the beginning of the Water 7 Arc, until circumstances forced them to become allies at the end of the same arc and the Enies Lobby Arc. Franky's dream is to create and ride a ship capable of circumnavigating the world, and he built the Thousand Sunny and joined the Straw Hat Pirates to fulfill his dream.
	<br><br>
	He currently has a bounty of 94,000,000 Beli.</p>
