	<p>"Knight of the Sea" Jinbe is the helmsman of the Straw Hat Pirates. He is the tenth member of the crew and the ninth to join, doing so during the Wano Country Arc.
	<br><br>
	Jinbe is a whale shark fish-man and a master of Fish-Man Karate. His dream is to fulfill his former captain Fisher Tiger's dying wish of coexistence and equality between humans and fish-men.
	<br><br>
	He was a member of the Sun Pirates, eventually becoming its second captain after the death of their original captain, Tiger. He eventually became one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, though he resigned during the Battle of Marineford. He befriended Monkey D. Luffy during the war and later allied with him and his crew to prevent the New Fish-Man Pirates' coup d'Ã©tat against the Neptune Royal Family of the Ryugu Kingdom. Luffy invited him to join the Straw Hat Pirates, but Jinbe held it off until severing ties with Big Mom during the Whole Cake Island Arc.
	<br><br>
	After staying behind in Totto Land to protect the Sun Pirates from Big Mom's wrath, Jinbe returned to the Straw Hats during the Wano Country Arc and officially announced his status as a member of the crew.
	<br><br>
	He currently has a bounty of 438,000,000 Beli.</p>
